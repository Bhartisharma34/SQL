**Mastering Data with SQL**

**Summary**

Welcome to my SQL repository! As a data enthusiast, I believe that understanding and manipulating data is a superpower. This repository is a collection of my projects and practice queries in SQL, designed to showcase my skills in data retrieval, analysis, and management.

**The Project: Building a Strong Foundation**

This repository serves as a digital notebook for my journey with SQL. It contains various .sql files, each tackling a different problem or dataset. The goal is to build a strong foundation in a variety of SQL concepts, from basic SELECT statements to more complex joins, subqueries, and window functions.

**What's Inside**

You'll find a series of .sql files, each one a self-contained project or exercise. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
Data Cleaning: Queries focused on handling messy data, identifying duplicates, and correcting errors.
Data Analysis: Scripts that perform aggregations, calculations, and generate insights from raw data.
Database Design: Examples of creating schemas, tables, and defining relationships.
Problem Solving: Queries that solve specific data challenges, often based on real-world scenarios.

**Key Learnings**

Working on these projects has helped me master several key areas of SQL, including:
Subqueries: How to use one query to inform another, enabling powerful and complex data filtering.
Joins: Connecting data from multiple tables to create a unified view.
Window Functions: Performing calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row.
Data Aggregation: Using functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, and GROUP BY to summarize data.

**Tech Stack**

MySQL: The core language for all data queries.
